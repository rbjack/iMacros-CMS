CMS Automation with iMacros
===========================

This applicatios is for developers who are tired of manually tracking and repetitively 
entering the same copy/content into different CMS development envioronments.

This application and workflow creates a system that automates content entry all the way through to production.
It frees your mind from manually tracking the state of the databases on multiple server enviornments.

Unlike tracking content changes through confluence, the application and workflow can be version controlled and 
implemented by anyone on your development team.
